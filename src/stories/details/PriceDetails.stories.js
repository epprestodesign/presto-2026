## Price Details

The breakdown modal behind **Price Details ›** on a Book Reservation room card:
per-night line items → hotel fee → taxes → **secondary custom fees** → total, and
a Reserve Room CTA.

### Secondary custom fees (DES-453)
Organizers configure up to **three** fees, at the event level or the event hotel
level. Each has a custom name, a dollar amount, a basis (*per room night* or
*per reservation*), and a custom description.

Guests see the **calculated charge only** — matching the live booking site. The
rate and the description live on the ⓘ tooltip, so a $5/night fee on a four-night
stay reads simply as **$20.00**.

The three-fee cap is enforced in \`src/lib/secondaryFees.js\`, not in this
template, so every surface that shows fees agrees. See *Four Configured* below:
the fourth fee never renders.
