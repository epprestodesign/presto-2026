## Reservation Summary

The shared summary body — hotel, room, stay dates, then the itemized price
breakdown. Rendered read-only here, exactly as the checkout right rail and the
cart fly-out render it, which is why DES-456 fixes the fee display **once** and
every consumer inherits it.

### Secondary custom fees (DES-456)
Up to **three** named fees sit below the nightly rows and Taxes. Each shows its
calculated charge; the rate (*per room night* / *per reservation*) and the
organizer's description are on the ⓘ.

Fees are **charged at booking**, so they land in **Due Today** while the room cost
becomes **Balance due** — the three-fee example bills $${THREE_FEES_TOTAL}.00 now
and leaves $${ROOM_COST}.00 owed at the property.

> **Arithmetic is caller-owned.** The component renders \`subtotals\` as given; it
> never re-adds the fees. Use \`secondaryFeesTotal()\` from
> \`src/lib/secondaryFees.js\` when building them so the two can't drift.
